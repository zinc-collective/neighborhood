# Neighborhood

_It's our world. Not Zuckerberg's._

### Made on Main Street, Not Market Street

Neighborhood is community-source software. We're not owned by private banks or
billionaires. Neighborhood is 100% owned by our Contributors, Operators and
Residents.

### You are Now Free to Move About The Internet

If your chosen Neighborhood isn't reliable or safe, it's easy to move to a
different one. All of your writing, photos, videos, interactions, and
relationships are securely portable. Once you've moved, you can remove your old
data and leave a public forwarding address.

### Not Just Sustainable, Restorative

Neighborhood is designed to be socioeconomically restorative. We incorporate
restorative justice principles and practices into our operating agreement, our
culture, our design, and our code itself.

## Design

Neighborhood's design goal is to encourage Mr. Rogers like experiences on the
web. Kindness, not civility. Firmness, not cruelty. We believe such a social
network must prioritize designing for professional operators build and maintain
trust, set and maintain healthy boundaries, and can make a living wage while
doing it.

### Experience Design

Neighborhoods are composed of personal, social or commercial Spaces. These
Spaces are connected by the Sidewalk, where the hustle and bustle of the
Neighborhood streams as Events happening within a Resident's Sphere. Residents
may adjust their Sphere to ignore incoming or block outgoing Events.

### Architecture

Our architectural priorities are:

1. Diverse, wide, warm community.
2. Stable, reliable release cadence.
3. By and for small, cohesive groups.

For the frontend, we rely on [Tailwind UI][tailwind-ui].
